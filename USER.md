# Deploy Platform - User Guide

Deploy is a modern deployment platform that allows you to deploy both static and dynamic web applications with zero configuration. It's similar to Vercel but runs on your own AWS infrastructure.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Sign Up
1. Visit the Deploy platform homepage
2. Click "Get Started" or "Sign Up"
3. Create your account with email and password
4. Verify your account (if email verification is enabled)

### 2. Sign In
1. Click "Sign In" on the homepage
2. Enter your credentials
3. You'll be redirected to your dashboard

## 📱 Dashboard Overview

Your dashboard provides:
- **Projects Overview**: See all your deployed projects
- **Deployment History**: Track deployment status and logs
- **Analytics**: Monitor your project performance
- **Account Settings**: Manage your profile and preferences

## 🌐 Deploying Your First Project

### Static Sites (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)

1. **Start Deployment**
   - Navigate to the Deploy page
   - Enter your GitHub repository URL
   - Select "Static Site" as deployment type

2. **Configure Build Settings**
   - **Build Commands**: Default is `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Custom Subdomain**: Optional - leave blank for auto-generated subdomain
   - Review your settings

3. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Watch real-time build logs
   - Your site will be live once deployment completes

**Example Build Commands for Static Sites:**
```bash
# React/Next.js
npm install && npm run build

# Vue.js
npm install && npm run build

# Angular
npm install && ng build --prod

# Vite projects
npm install && npm run build
```

### Dynamic Applications (Node.js, Express, etc.)

1. **Start Deployment**
   - Navigate to the Deploy page
   - Enter your GitHub repository URL
   - Select "Dynamic Application" as deployment type

2. **Configure Settings**
   - **Build Commands**: Commands to build your app
   - **Run Commands**: Commands to start your server
   - **Expose Ports**: Ports your application uses (optional)
   - **Custom Subdomain**: Optional subdomain name

3. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Monitor build and deployment progress
   - Your application will be accessible via the provided URL

**Example Commands for Dynamic Apps:**
```bash
# Node.js/Express
Build: npm install
Run: npm start

# Next.js (SSR)
Build: npm install && npm run build
Run: npm start

# Python/Django
Build: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

## 📊 Monitoring Deployments

### Real-time Logs
- View live deployment logs during build process
- Monitor application startup and runtime logs
- Debug issues with detailed error messages

### Deployment Status
- **QUEUED**: Deployment is waiting to start
- **BUILDING**: Build process is in progress
- **RUNNING**: Application is successfully deployed
- **FAILED**: Deployment encountered an error

### Project URLs
- **Static Sites**: Served via global CDN with fast loading times
- **Dynamic Apps**: Direct connection to your running container
- **Custom Domains**: Use your own domain (contact support)

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables
Currently, environment variables need to be configured in your repository. Support for platform-level environment variables is coming soon.

### Custom Domains
- Auto-generated subdomains are provided by default
- Custom subdomain can be specified during deployment
- Full custom domain support available (contact support)

### Build Optimization
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files
- Optimize your `package.json` for faster installs
- Consider using build caches for faster subsequent deployments

## 📁 Supported Project Types

### Static Sites
- ✅ React (Create React App, Vite)
- ✅ Vue.js (Vue CLI, Vite)
- ✅ Angular
- ✅ Static HTML/CSS/JS
- ✅ Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby
- ✅ Next.js (Static Export)

### Dynamic Applications
- ✅ Node.js/Express
- ✅ Next.js (SSR)
- ✅ NestJS
- ✅ Python/Flask/Django
- ✅ Any dockerizable application

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

### Repository Access
- Ensure your GitHub repository is accessible
- Use public repositories or configure access tokens
- Keep sensitive data in environment variables, not in code

### Security Headers
- HTTPS is automatically provided
- CORS is configured for cross-origin requests
- Security headers are applied by default

### Data Privacy
- Your code is processed securely during deployment
- Build artifacts are stored in secure S3 buckets
- Application logs are retained for debugging purposes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Failures**
- Check your build commands are correct
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in `package.json`
- Review build logs for specific error messages

**Runtime Errors**
- Verify your run commands start the server correctly
- Check that your application listens on the correct port
- Review application logs for runtime issues

**Connectivity Issues**
- Ensure your GitHub repository URL is correct and accessible
- Check that your application isn't trying to bind to localhost
- For dynamic apps, make sure your server accepts connections from all interfaces (0.0.0.0)

### Getting Help
- Check deployment logs for detailed error information
- Review this documentation for configuration help
- Contact support for infrastructure or account issues

## 📈 Billing & Limits

### Current Limitations
- Build timeout: 10 minutes
- Runtime timeout: 3 hours for dynamic applications
- Storage: Included for reasonable usage
- Bandwidth: Included for reasonable usage

### Fair Usage
- Platform is designed for development and small to medium production workloads
- Excessive resource usage may be limited
- Enterprise plans available for high-traffic applications
